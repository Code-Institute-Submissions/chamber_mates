<!-- Replacement for the same-named template file in the django-forms-bootstrap package. The only change here
is replacing a <p> tag with a <div>.
    
This is necessary because the html generated by django for field.help_text is a <ul></ul> - and I discovered that 
HTML5 does not allow <ul> elements to be inside <p> elements. And when the browser encounters such a violation, it
adds a closing </p> tag before the <ul> The result is an empty <p class="help-block"></p>, followed by a <ul> with
no class/styling.

In order to style these things sensible with bootstrap, it is necessary to replace the <p> with a <div>, as below.
I need Django to find this template before the one provided by the package - this is why I have moved the
django-forms-bootstrap app to the bottom of INSTALLED_APPS -->

{% if field.help_text %}
    <div class="help-block">{{ field.help_text|safe }}</div>
{% endif %}
